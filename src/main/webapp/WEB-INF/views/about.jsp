	KeepItFresh is a web application that helps people to track freshness of the stored items. 
The app notifies users via email that some items are going to expire soon. 
Users are able to customize how many days before expiration they want to get a notification.

	The idea of this application was born in our small group from five persons which absolute majority is the girls. 
That is why the problem of overdue cosmetics, creams, lotions etc. 
Known to us very well and feeling by each of us. All girls know that bunch of cosmetics has expiration date only on packages. 
Sometimes you throw it after opening and later you donâ€™t have a chance to check again when it is going to be expired. 
	</p>
	<p>
Fortunately, now we have amazing application - KeepItFresh which solves this problem. All you need to do is just insert information about new items, 
including name, category, and expiration date. You will get a notification about items that are going to expire soon. 
In the settings, you choose when you what to get these notifications.

	We hope that this application will be helpful and useful for users. In the future, we planning to add more features to it and make it even better than now!
